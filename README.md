This database provides a unified system for **sales and financial analytics**, integrating data from customers, products, markets, costs, and sales. It offers optimized reporting through **pre-computed views, stored procedures, and window functions** to track performance and generate insights efficiently.  

## **Schema Overview**  

### **Fact Tables**  
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Monthly sales data by product and customer.  
- **fact_gross_price**: Product prices by fiscal year.

- **fact_post_invoice_deductions**: Deductions after invoicing.  
- **fact_freight_cost**: Freight and shipping costs.  
- **fact_manufacturing_cost**: Product manufacturing costs.

### **Dimension Tables**

   - **Top Markets & Customers**: Identify top-performing markets and customers by net sales.
